            <h5 class="faq-item-header">Can I use my product/license key on more than one computer?</h5>
            <p>
                Yes, you can use your key on up to 5 devices simultaneously. Activating the key on a 6th
                device will automatically deactivate one of the 5 previously used devices.

                Currently only Windows is supported, but support for MacOS is coming soon. Yes, you will

            <h5 class="faq-item-header">I never received an email or product key, what do I do?</h5>
            <p>
                First, double check your spam folder. In rare cases it can take up to an hour to receive
                your email confirmation. If you still havenâ€™t received your key within an hour, send an
                email to
                <a class="link-underlined" target="_blank" href="mailto:feedback@phoenixblocker.com"

            <h5 class="faq-item-header">Is there a way to leave feedback on the app?</h5>
            <p>
                Phoenix is constantly improving and any feedback on how it
                can be further improved is very much appreciated. Let us know your thoughts. Send an
                email to
                <a class="link-underlined" target="_blank" href="mailto:feedback@phoenixblocker.com"

            <h5 class="faq-item-header">Can I use Phoenix Blocker if I'm using S Mode in Windows 10/11?</h5>
            <p>
                Due to S Mode being highly restrictive and denying access to the Windows Registry, Phoenix Blocker will not work with Windows installations running S Mode. If you wish to use Phoenix Blocker you must disable S Mode.
